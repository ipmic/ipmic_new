IPMic -- IP Microphone  or  Microphone Over IP (Internet Protocol)

	What is it?
The IPMic project is going to be a way to develop live-application microphones
which will work over a local network (LAN). It is basically a software to allow
live real-time audio transmission from multiple senders to one or more servers.

	Idea
For example, if you're going to do a lecture and you can't find a microphone in
premise, get your smartphone from pocket, connect it wireless to your computer
and start talk!
Microphones in market are expensive and only works with its own
hardware/equipment, so what about a cheap and dynamic/portable solution?!

	Originality and "reinventing the wheel"
I suppose there's no duplication or "NIH syndrome"[1] in IPMic itself.
I have "NIH syndrome"[1], but I can't reinvent the wheel all the times --
impracticable :-)

	Getting started
At the moment we're organizing our repository and preparing the documentation,
but you can still find out some docs in docs/. Go to docs/ and start reading
