======================================
Microphone Over IP (Internet Protocol)
======================================

:Date: 08/2017


What is it?
===========

The IPMic project is going to be a way to develop
live-application microphones which will work over a local
network (LAN). It is basically a software to allow live
real-time audio transmission from multiple senders to one
or more servers.


Idea
====

For example, if you're going to do a lecture and you can't
find a microphone in premise, get your smartphone from
pocket, connect it wireless to your computer and start
talk! Microphones in market are expensive and only works
with its own hardware/equipment, so what about a cheap and
dynamic/portable solution?!


Originality and "reinventing the wheel"
=======================================

I suppose there's no duplication or "NIH syndrome" [1]_ in
IPMic itself. I have "NIH syndrome", but I can't reinvent
the wheel all the times -- impracticable :-)

Getting started
===============

At the moment we're organizing our repository and preparing
the documentation, but you can still find out some docs in
docs/. Go to docs/ and start reading 00_intro.txt :-)
